## Note
Some of these things may never get implemented.
And even if they do, there is no guarantee that these things are the next things I will implement.

## TODO
 * Switch sensor connection to SPI
 * Split sensor reading and data storage to different Tasks
 * Add some javascript to more smoothly update the waiting screen
 * Add client with live graphs
