## Note
Some of these things may never get implemented.
And even if they do, there is no guarantee that these things are the next things I will implement.

## TODO
 * Switch sensor connection to hardware SPI
 * Split sensor reading and data storage to different Tasks?
 * Add client with live graphs(Java standalone or Javascript in the web interface)
 * Improve download web page to show the rough size of the files to download
 * Automatically scale up sensor ranges if the read value is close to the current max
 * Show the actual measurement rate on the download page
